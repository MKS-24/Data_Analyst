Data Preparation:
Loaded Titanic combined dataset (train + test + gender_submission merged).
Removed duplicate rows to avoid biased results.
Checked columns and identified missing values:
Filled missing Age values with the column mean.
Dropped the entire Cabin column (too many missing values).
Filled missing Fare values with mean.
Dropped rows missing Embarked data.
Converted Age from float to integer for easier interpretation.

Basic Statistics:
Total passengers counted.
Survival ratio calculated:
Approximately 38% survived, 62% did not survive.
Survival Analysis by Different Features

Gender-wise Survival:
Females had a significantly higher survival count compared to males.
Visualized via bar plot showing clear gender disparity in survival rates.
Passenger Class (Pclass) Survival:
1st class passengers had the highest survival counts.
2nd class had moderate survival.
3rd class had the lowest survival counts.
Highlights the impact of socio-economic status on survival chances.

Age and Survival:
Correlation between Age and Survived is negative (slightly).
Younger passengers had better survival chances than older passengers.
Heatmap visualization confirms this negative correlation.

Key Insights:
Gender is a strong survival indicator, with females more likely to survive.
Passenger class matters: higher classes had better survival rates, indicating possible priority in rescue.
Younger passengers survived more often compared to older ones.
Missing data was carefully handled to maintain dataset integrity.
